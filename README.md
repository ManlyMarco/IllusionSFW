# IllusionSFW
Plugin turns off content that can be considered NSFW in some Illusion games (leaving SFW maker and studio). It disables free H, story mode, nudity (can't strip), some items in maker and studio, some plugins and some game functions. All content creation functions are still available (both character maker and studio), but NSFW items are disabled.

One of the main uses for this plugin is streaming the game, and creating SFW artworks in studio if you don't want to see the lewd stuff.

> Please note that some NSFW or questionable content might still be accessible, especially if this plugin encounters an issue during loading. Before streaming always test the game to make sure that there is nothing wrong and that all NSFW mods are correctly disabled. Always excercise caution, there is no warranty on this plugin and only you are responsible for any bad outcomes reached by using this plugin.

> These games are not suitable for minors even with this plugin installed.

## How to use
0. You need to have at least BepInEx 5.0, KKAPI 1.11.1 and ABMX v4.2 installed for this plugin to work.
1. Download the latest release.
2. Extract the release to your game directory.
3. If your custom game launcher is new enough, it should now display an "Enable safe mode" option. If it does, enable it and you're done!
4. If you can't see the option, start the game once, then edit the config file `BepInEx\config\KK_SFW.cfg` and set `Disable NSFW content = true`. After editing and saving the config file, start the game again and the plugin should now be active.

**Note:** You can turn the plugin off and on freely, it does not make any permanent changes to the game.

**Warning:** You have to close all instances of the game and studio when turning the plugin on or off. If game files are being used as the switch happens you might experience issues.
